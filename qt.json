    "answer": "[\"Amino\", \"Carboxyl\", \"R\"]",
    "explanation": "A typical amino acid molecule has a central carbon atom (alpha-carbon) bonded to four different groups: an amino group ($-NH_2$), a carboxyl group ($-COOH$), a hydrogen atom ($-H$), and a variable side chain known as the R-group. The R-group is what distinguishes one amino acid from another, and its chemical properties determine the overall characteristics of the amino acid."

    "answer": "[\"Starch hydrolysis into Maltose\"]",
    "explanation": "Amylase is an enzyme that specifically catalyzes the hydrolysis (breakdown) of starch into smaller sugar molecules, primarily maltose. This process is crucial in digestion, as starch is a complex carbohydrate that needs to be broken down into simpler sugars for absorption. The experiment described demonstrates this by observing the disappearance of starch over time using an iodine test."

    "answer": "[\"The blue color of the drop gradually reduces with time and finally obtains the yellow/brown color of Iodine\"]",
    "explanation": "In the Amylase activity on starch, starch initially gives a blue-black color with iodine. As amylase breaks down starch into maltose (which does not react with iodine to produce a blue color), the concentration of starch decreases. Consequently, when iodine is added to samples over time, the intensity of the blue color diminishes, eventually reverting to the yellow/brown color of the iodine solution itself, indicating the complete hydrolysis of starch."

    "answer": "[\"Fats are solid at room temperature, while oils are liquid at room temperature\"]",
    "explanation": "The distinction between fats and oils is primarily based on their physical state at room temperature. Fats, such as butter or lard, are typically solid due to a higher proportion of saturated fatty acids, which pack tightly together. Oils, such as olive oil or vegetable oil, are liquid because they contain a higher proportion of unsaturated fatty acids, whose kinks prevent tight packing."

    "options": "[\"Water is a good solvent for aquatic nutrients\", \"Water has a high specific heat capacity to keep temperatures stable\", \"Ice is less dense than liquid water, so it floats and insulates the water below\", \"Water's cohesive forces prevent aquatic organisms from sinking\"]",
    "answer": "[\"Ice is less dense than liquid water, so it floats and insulates the water below\"]",
    "explanation": "A unique property of water is that its solid form (ice) is less dense than its liquid form. This causes ice to float on the surface of water bodies. This floating ice layer then acts as an insulating barrier, preventing the underlying water from freezing completely, thus preserving a liquid environment at the bottom where aquatic organisms can survive through cold periods."
